# Overview

#### **Final Summary of Enterprise Clean Architecture**

In large-scale enterprise applications, Clean Architecture is extended with additional layers to enhance modularity, scalability, and maintainability. Below is a **summary of all 15 layers**:

**Core Layers (Business Logic)**

1. **Domain Layer** – Defines core business logic, entities, value objects, and domain events.
2. **Application Layer** – Implements use cases, CQRS commands/queries, and orchestrates domain logic.
3. **Core Interfaces Layer** – Holds repository contracts, domain services, and shared abstractions.

**Infrastructure & Data Layers**

4. **Repository Layer** – Provides a consistent data access API via interfaces.
5. **Infrastructure Layer** – Implements repositories, external API clients, logging, and persistence.
6. **Data Access Layer** – Manages database connections, migrations, and low-level SQL interactions.

**Integration & API Layers**

7. **API Layer** – Exposes public APIs with controllers, authentication, and middleware.
8. **Messaging Layer** – Enables event-driven communication using RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Azure Service Bus.

**Performance & Monitoring Layers**

9. **Caching Layer** – Stores frequently accessed data in-memory using Redis or MemoryCache.
10. **Logging & Monitoring Layer** – Collects logs, monitors performance, and provides observability.

**Security & Background Processing**

11. **Security Layer** – Manages authentication, authorization, and encryption policies.
12. **Background Jobs Layer** – Executes scheduled and long-running tasks (Hangfire, Quartz.NET).

**Frontend, Testing, and DevOps Layers**

13. **UI / Presentation Layer** – Handles frontend rendering (Blazor, React, Angular, or MVC Views).
14. **Testing Layer** – Contains unit tests, integration tests, and automated quality assurance.
15. **DevOps Layer** – Manages CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and infrastructure automation.
